# ssc-bkn-2019
Scraping publicly available public servant application (PNS) in Indonesia, 2019. 

Requirements: 
1. Selenium with Webdriver already installed (or you can modify them yourself)
2. Pandas

Note: 
I export the dataset into DTA (Stata File), as it's my main data driver. But you could modify them into other format with pandas (JSON, Excel, CSV, etc).
